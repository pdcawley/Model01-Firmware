# Keyboardio Model 01 Maltron Inspired firmware

_My personal layout for the Keyboardio Model 01_

### Quick Start

I assume you're already familiar with the [KeyboardIO Quick Start Instructions](https://github.com/andrewgdotcom/Model01-Firmware/blob/master/README.md) and don't need them repeating here.

<h3>_Another_ layout?</h3>

Yeah, there are are enough keyboard layouts in the world already, but this one is mine. I had my fingers warped early by a Maltron ergonomic keyboard, which I learned with their custom Malt Layout and it's what my hands want to use on any split keyboard.

The chief problem with converting from Lillian Malt's quite brilliant layout is working out where to put the keys that 'should' be in the 8 keys per thumb clusters that you'll find on a Maltron 'board. I'm not sure I have that entirely solved yet.

### Building gotchas

You'll need to use a SpaceCadet plugin with https://github.com/keyboardio/Kaleidoscope-SpaceCadet/pull/8 applied, which you could grab from [my fork](https://github.com/pdcawley/Kaleidoscope-SpaceCadet/)
